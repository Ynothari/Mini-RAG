# üìö Mini-RAG: Retrieval Augmented Engine

The **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** engine is a powerful application for document retrieval, summarization, and interactive question-answering. Built with **LangChain**, **Streamlit**, and **Pinecone**, this project offers a seamless web interface to interact with your documents in a conversational manner.

With Mini-RAG, you can upload multiple PDF files, generate vector embeddings, and ask natural language questions. Chat history is preserved, providing a smooth and interactive user experience.
